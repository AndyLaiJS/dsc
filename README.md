# Google Developer Students Club @ CUHK 
This was where the project of building a replacement website for CUHK's Google DSC was done on, where it would be "published" would be on the official Github account of Google DSC @ CUHK. 

Numerous efforts to bring the design language of Google into this project, including the colour scheme and the font. Feel free to play around with the project. The project is built on VueJS, so make sure to have it installed on your system.
